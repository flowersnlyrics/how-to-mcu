# Overview 
This project will forward stdout and stdin from the System Workbench IDE console to the MCU's UART. Access to the MCU's UART interface will be through a terminal emulator program called PuTTY. See download link in the main README.

# Procedure
1. Make sure your build configuration is setup correctly by building and running your code. 
2. Go to the Device Manager to find the COM port where the UART will be accessed from.
3. to be continued stay tuned
