# Answer for one set of numbers

1. Don't let the user enter `0`. Keep asking user for a number until the number they enter is not `0`. Use this logic for the rest of the assignment.  
*After user enters their numbers...*
1. Check if `x` is equal to `y`. Print `x equals y` if it returns true. Print `x does not equal y` if it's false. 
2. Take the modulus of `x` and `y` and print the result. 
3. Divide, add, multiply and subtract `a` and `b` and print all the results in that order. 
4. If `a` is greater than `b` **and** `x` is less than `y` then print `Amanda is cool`. Otherwise print `Jennifer is cool`. 
5. If `a` is equal to `b` **or** `x` is equal to `y` then print `ah, a set of equal numbers`, otherwise print `alas, no numbers are equal`. 
6. If `x` divided by `y` is `>2` then print `2` five times. If `x` divided by `y` is `<2` then print `2` four times. If it's equal to `2` print `2` two times, otherwise just print `"too many twos"`.
7. BONUS: Ask the user to type a goodbye message and make it the last thing you print (after the results of all these questions!)
