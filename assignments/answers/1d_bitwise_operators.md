# Check your answers against mine

### Handwritten mistakes SORRY
  - The page numbers are off by 1 sorry that's my bad  
  - Round one number two should be **127** NOT 128
  - Round 1 I got 8 and 9 mixed up 
  
  
### Other things to note
- Round 1 number 7 will print `0x1e00` because of the format specifier in `printf` but the answer `0x00` is still correct because we are assuming the variable can only hold 8-bits.
