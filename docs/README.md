# An Overview of the Resources 
Documentation is important when learning new hardware and a new processor

### Nucleo resources
* **Schematic**: Tells you how the GPIO from the microcontroller are wired up. 
* **User Manual** : EVKs usually come with sort of user manual to get you started or to introduce you as to why things were done certain ways on the evaluation board or different configurations available on the evaluation kit thru jumpers, solder bridges or other connections.

### STM32 Resources
* **Datasheet**: Hardware details i.e. alternate functions of GPIO, eletrical specifications, description of hardware specs, etc. 
* **Reference Manual**: Programming details i.e. how to configure certain peripherals, the available features on each of the peripherals, register descriptions, etc.
